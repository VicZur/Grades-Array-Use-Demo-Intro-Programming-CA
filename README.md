# Grades-Array-Use-Demo-Intro-Programming-CA

This program was created as part of the Assessment Project for an Intro to Programming module (Level 8) at the Dublin Business School.

It received a final grade of 100%, earned for demonstrating a high standard of coding practices and adding additional features.

### The project requirements
A program that creates an array using the grades values 34.7, 56.9, 75, 52, 92.2

The program should then display the array size, print the grade 56.9, and print all the grades.

### Additional Functionality Added
In addition to the above requirements, I chose to make this program more realistic and useful. It incorporates a default program with the specifications above, but also provides the users a range of additional features. The user is able to input their own grades, search to see if a grade is in the array, order the grades or run the default program.
